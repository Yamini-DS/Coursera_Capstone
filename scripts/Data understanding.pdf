1.Now the data used for solving this business problem is Data collisions collected
or given.
2.In this data collisions there are numerical factors which are influencing the target
variable severity of the accident
3.So in this there are almost 37 features which are impacting the target variable
4.Then this data has to be cleaned and find the statistics for the features so that
we don't get down on the accuracy or correct predictions by making or involving
any unnecessary variables into the data. So removing all the bad data or not useful
data and making use of only relevant data makes the predictions and insights much
more efficient and accurate.
5. This data has been collected from the Seattle, USA which can be used for solving
any such same type of situation and prevent any such accidents happening at any place.
6. Data is also collected on weekly basis at Seattle by SDOT Traffic Management
 Division, Traffic Records Group organization Analyst.
7. This data includes all types of collisions. Collisions will display at the intersection or
mid-block of a segment. Timeframe: 2004 to Present.
8. For more info check out the Metadata on vehicle collisions.pdf present in the
same scripts folder.
